Understanding Directory Hierarchy

In Linux, understanding the directory hierarchy is crucial for efficient navigation and file management. A Linux system's directory structure, also known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is a defined tree structure that helps to prevent files from being scattered all over the system and instead organise them in a logical and easy-to-navigate manner.

/: Root directory, the top level of the file system.
/home: User home directories.
/bin: Essential binary executables.
/sbin: System administration binaries.
/etc: Configuration files.
/var: Variable data (logs, spool files).
/usr: User programs and data.
/lib: Shared libraries.
/tmp: Temporary files.
